Python is a tool that is similar and as useful as R Studio. Python can be used as a calculator, can manipulate strings, can create lists, and can be used as many other functions. Additionally, Python can create plots. Below are some examples:

```{python}
# python as a calculator
3-2
3+2
3**2
```

```{python}
# indexing and lists
list1=[1,2,3,4]
list2=['a','b','c','d']
list1[0]
list2[1]
list2[2:]
```

```{r}
# reticulate

library(reticulate)

hi<-"Hello"
```

```{python}
hi="world"
print(r.hi,hi)
```

Through reticulate, we are now able to allow R and Python to play together. Objects can be named the same thing in R and Python without conflict.![](/post/2021-05-08-powerful-python_files/python-logo-master-v3-TM-flattened.png)
